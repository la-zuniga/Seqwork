# Seqwork
An R package to work with data tables from the DADA2 pipeline (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) made for biostatistical programming at MTSU 2022. by Luis ZA (lazuniga97@proton.me)

This package requires phyloseq, vegan, and ggplot2. Phyloseq does not seem to be compatible with the newest R studio version (4.2.2), and so building the tarball may fail due to this current incompatability.
